## React Server Components in Next.js

### a) Server Components
- **Default Mode**: All components in Next.js are Server Components by default.
- **Functionality**: Can perform tasks such as reading files or fetching data from databases.
- **Limitations**: Cannot use React hooks or handle user interactions directly.

### b) Client Components
- **Enabling Client Mode**: Add `"use client"` at the top of the component file.
- **Functionality**: Can use hooks and manage user interactions.
- **Limitations**: Cannot access server-side resources like databases or files directly.

## Routing in Next.js

Next.js uses a file-based routing system that simplifies route management.

### Conventions
- **Folder Structure**: All routes are placed within the `app` folder.
- **File Naming**: Each route file is named `page.tsx`.
- **Folder-Based Path Segments**: Each folder represents a segment in the URL.

### Example Routes
- **Blog Page**: `/blog`
  - `/blog/first` (First blog post)
  - `/blog/second` (Second blog post)

## Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routes allow Next.js to create pages for dynamic content without duplicating files.

- **Dynamic Route Example**: `/products/[id]`
  - `/products/1` (Product 1 details)
  - `/products/2` (Product 2 details)

- **Nested Dynamic Routes**:
  - Example: `/products/[id]/review/[reviewId]`
    - `/products/1/review/1` (Review 1 for Product 1)

### Catch-All Segments
Catch-all routes allow flexibility for complex URL structures, such as documentation sites.

#### Example Use Case
For a documentation site with multiple features and concepts:
- **Route Structure**:
  - `/[featureId]/[conceptId]` supports all feature-concept combinations.
- **Simplifies Routing**:
  - Instead of 400 static routes (20 features Ã— 20 concepts), only one dynamic route structure is needed.
